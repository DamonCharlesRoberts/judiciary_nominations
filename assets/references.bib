abstract = {Research has shown that voters are willing to stereotype candidates on the basis of their gender, which can sometimes pose obstacles and sometimes prove advantageous for female politicians. But the literature is uncertain about how candidate gender interacts with candidate party affiliation to shape voters' perceptions. In this article, I draw on political psychology, the women and politics literature, and recent work on partisan "trait ownership" to suggest that the application of gender stereotypes will be limited by the salience of partisan stereotypes. I use nationally representative survey data and a content analysis of news coverage from the 2006 U.S. Senate elections to test the argument. Focusing on voter evaluations of candidate traits, I find that party stereotypes are more powerful than gender stereotypes, and that assessments of candidate attributes can be affected by news coverage when candidates are portrayed in ways that challenge traditional partisan images. The results suggest that gender stereotyping is limited by the relevance of party stereotypes, and that as the Republican and Democratic parties continue to polarize at the elite level, the importance of partisan stereotyping is likely to increase. {\textcopyright} The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2011.},

		Q: In low information voting environments, do voters use gender as a cue to guess the candidates ideological stances?
		Argues:
		- Low information voting situations often require voters to use various cues to make guesses about the candidate and their stances. One such cue is gender. Specifically, voters use gender as a cue to determine a candidate's issue stances where there is no other information. Voters assume that female candidates are more liberal than male candidates who are assumed to be more conservative in these low-information voting environments.
		Methods:
		- Use data from the 1986 through the 1995 ANES
		- Women Democratic candidates fare better than Democratic male candidates among more liberal votes and worse among conservative voters - these effects are particularly pronounced for those who report knowing little about the candidates. However, these cues get a bit muddied for Republican voters asked about female Republican candidates - that is Republicans have a harder time to use gender as an ideological cue to distinguish between a male and female Republican candidate than Democrats do in making assumptions about the differences in ideological position between male and female Democratic candidates.

Yet it remains unresolved which specific candidate traits voters find most important. In political science it is often argued that competence-related traits are most influential, whereas work in social psychology suggests that warmth-related traits are more influential. Here we test which character trait is the more influential in global candidate evaluations and vote choice using observational data from the ANES 1984--2008 and an original experiment conducted on a representative sample of English partisan respondents. Across the two studies we find that warmth is more influential than competence, leadership and integrity. Importantly, results hold across a wide range of alternative specifications and robustness analyses. We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical implications of the results.},

Using two national surveys, we document a propensity for the U.S. public to prefer male Republican leadership the most in times of security threat, and female Democratic leadership the least. We theorize a causal process by which terrorist threat influences the effect of stereotypes on candidate evaluations conditional on politician partisanship. We test this framework with an original experiment:a nationally representative sample was presented with a mock election that varied the threat context and the gender and partisanship of the candidates. We find that masculine stereotypes have a negative influence on both male and female Democratic candidates in good times (thus reaffirming the primacy of party stereotypes), but only on the female Democratic candidate when terror threat is primed. Republican candidates---both male and female---are unaffected by masculine stereotypes, regardless of the threat environment.},

		Chapter 1: 
		Q: Is candidate emergence better predicted by gender rather than sex differences?
		Argues:
		- People's gender personality help explain women's under-representation because politics and masculinity are congruent, variation in candidate emergence is better explained by gender differences rather than sex differences.
		- Masculine individuals are more likely to be recruited, perceive themselves as qualified, and express more political ambition
		- good literature review of definition and consequences of differences between gender and sex
		- women and men with more masculine traits will be less susceptible to the qualification doubt that is well documented as a qualification gap between men and women - that women feel like they'd be less qualified running for office
		Chapter II:
		Q: Flushes out argument more and where the literature on the candidate emergence gap has missed some things
		Argues:
		- provides an incredible literature review of gender underrepresentation
		- Explanations for underrepresentation of women:
			1. demand side: tons of work in the 80's and 90's argued that the public was just not supportive of feminine candidates
			2. supply side: in the 2000s, this shifted with work showing that all else equal, women were electorally successful; this sparked a lot of literature arguing that underrepresentation is the result of a lack of women running for office.
		- They argue along with the supply side. They argue that it is not sex, but it is gender personality that is the cause of this underrepresentation. 
		- Define gender personality as ``an individual-level attribute that can be measured by an individual's self-identification with associated qualities such as ``confidence" and ``aggression" for masculine personalities and ``devotion to others" and ``warmth" for feminine personality.
		- They argue that women (and men) who have a more feminine gender personality are less likely to feel that they are qualified to run for office, less likely to be contacted or encouraged for office, and will express less political ambition. While these features have been documented, they have done so imprecisely because of people's focus on the candidates sex more so than their tendency to be more or less masculine in personality than their sex or presumed gender.
		- They do this by conducting a pretty large survey of city councilmembers. To get at gender personality, they use a portion of the Personal Attributes Questionnaire called the M-F scale which has been developed and worked on in the social psychology literature. Comparing this scale to others, they find that the factors do quite well actually. So they go with this throughout the rest of the chapters. 
		Chapter III:
		Q: Do those who have a more feminine gender personality express more qualification doubts?
		Argues:
		- Gender personality can come from a number of sources. One key source is sex-based socialization. Women tend to take on a more feminine personality because they are socialized to believe that those characteristics are what they are supposed to take on. The degree to which this socialization occurs and is successful helps to contribute to variation between individuals about whether men take on masculine personalities or feminine personalities and likewise for women.
		- Find that those who have more masculine personalities tend to see themselves as more qualified for political office than those with feminine personalities.
		- They also find that despite their feeling that they are more qualified, men tend to have fewer skills associated with success as a public servant. Looking at masculinity, those who score higher in masculine personality tend to report more of these skills than those with feminine personalities. Skills like policy knowledge, fundraising, public speaking, professional experience, self-promotion, and political connections. This shows that gender personality really is what is explaining these differences and not sex.
		Chapter IV:
		Q: Do those that have more masculine gender personalities receive more inquiries and invitations by political strategists to run for office?
		Argues:
		- Some studies show that recruitment and being asked to run for office is a more important decision factor for whether or not they run for office compared to men. We see, however, that there are biases in who people recruit to run for political office. Again, they argue that observations that men are recruited at higher frequencies than women is not really because of sex but based on their gender personality. 
		Chapter V:
		Q: Do those that have more masculine gender personalities express higher levels of political ambition than those with feminine personalities?
		Argues:
		- nascent ambition: an individual's expressed interest in running for political office generally
		- progressive ambition: measure of whether an individual who currently holds office would want to run for higher office
		- masculine personality does not directly predict progressive ambition. Gender does, exert a more subtle indirect influence. Masculine personality is positively related to feeling competent and supported in the process that leads to the decision to pursue a career in public office, however.
		Chapter VI:
		Q: What are the consequences of this?
		Argues:
		- They are pretty deep. Even when we see more representation of women in politics, we do not see more representation of feminine personalities in politics.
		- To solve this, there needs to be a change in party elite rhetoric and for elites to actively work to recruit and encourage a more diverse group of people to run for office. We should also reward men who reject excessive masculinity in politics and express more feminine expressions.

		Chapter I:
		Q: What does the intersection of race and gender mean for the underrepresentation of these candidates?
		Argues:
		- Looking at patterns for candidate emergence and underrepresentation isn't the same for all women - those who also hold nonwhite identities have different experiences than white female candidates.
		- Further, we should see that while white women face gendered issues, they do not face race-based issues and are likely to have a better chance with the electorate than anyone of color due to white women's proximity to white men in geography. People of color are going to face more challenges as there are not too many majority-minority districts that they can leverage to overcome biases. WOC are going to face the biggest challenges as they are being hit with racial and gendered biases against them.
		- These ranks I provide above are not fixed and may vary, but this is kind of what the author is arguing anyhow.
		- When talking about minorities here, the focus is going to be those from common immigrant communities - Asian and Latinx. Does this because of their lack of attention both in the academic literature and among people in the public despite the amount of attention paid to immigration legislation. With the lack of attention they've received in the academic literature, a lot of the literature cited also apply to the experiences of Black women.
		- Contributions by the book:
			* the GRACE dataset - mixes both national data, interviews and surveys from the early 2000's
			* there are simultaneous pressures within communities and how electoral politics shape the possibilities for women of color's leadership and representation
			* the interviews from the book highlight that among candidates and legislators who are from immigrant communities, highlight differences between their experiences to that of those from other minority communities.
		Chapter II:
		- Describes the GRACE dataset.
		- Covers about 20 years worth of election data. Where it includes the race and gender of the candidates, the count of ballots for them, and district information. There are also two additional attached datasets including interviews with various candidates.
		Chapter III:
		Q: What are the contexts that these minority women must run for office in; how might these contexts effect the degree to which they put their hat in the ring?
		Argues:
		- On its own, gender doesn't explain really whether or not a candidate comes up with the idea on their own as to whether or not they are going to run for office. To look at this self-motivation to run for office needs to also include race. We see quite a bit of difference there.
		- people often reported that if you are a Latina or Asian women, you needed to be invited by someone to run for office. That to not really have that invitation meant that you just didn't run. They felt that these workshops and other things like that had limited value - you needed to find the right people that can take the sort of lifestyle that comes with politics and who is already interested. For women personal relationships are a constraint on their ability to have that sort of lifestyle; for men it is a resource. 
		Chapter IV:
		Q: Does having ``power in numbers" work differently for Latinos and Asian American men than Latinas and Asian American women?
		Argues:
		- The idea of ``power in numbers is that when you are running for office somewhere where there are a lot of co-racial voters, this helps much more for minorities than if you are running in a whitewashed district.
		- This ``power in numbers" advantage, however, is limited to men. As these sorts of districts are relatively rare, anyhow, this often makes this advantage quite rare and hard to come by.
		- Asian women and Latinas rely less on these highly co-racial districts than their male counterparts. The reasons for why this is the case probably depends.

		Introduction
		Q: Why has this upward trajectory from the 40s and 50s to the 70s and 90s on racially progressive attitudes seemingly stagnated with millennials?
		Argues:
		- Symbolic attitudes have not improved over time.
		- They argue that this stagnation on racial attitudes are the result of folks not doing the work that younger people in previous generations had done o make significant and positive chages in aggregate racial attitudes or in policies that aim to ameliorate racial disparities. They find that White millennials do have raically inluive attitudes, do value diversity, and do not want to be or appear racit. They also show that while they have gained the ablity to see it as a structural and systemic problem, they are not more emotionally invested in fixing these problems. As they do not have the emotional buy in, they are more likely to adopt a color-blind racia ideology and rely on diversity logic. These dominant racial ideologies among millennials provide no room for structural racism as an explanation for persistent racial disparities.
		- Critique long-standing measures in political science toward racial attitudes as they do not really capture current arguments and beliefs common among millenials. We need to look more cognitively. Their measure is called FIRE - Fear, acknowledgment of institutional racism, and empathy
		Chapter I:
		Q: What are the competing explanations of racial attitudes?
		Argues:
		- It dictates almost all of our lives
		- Theories about why whites  are not very approving of racial issues:
			- realistic group threat (and others hat emphasize social structure and group interests): Jim Sidanius. Whites' attidues about racially liberal policies stem from the perception that these policies work against their group interest in a zero-sum game for resources. The game is percieved as zero-sum in the sense tat due to a limited pool of resources, if one group is bound to benefit, the other loses These competing interests of groups by which you identify with and those dominant groups develop ideologies to justify and legitimize their hegemony.
			- sociopsycholoical models ofracial prejudice like symbolic racism, modern racism, racial resentment, authoritarian personality, and covert racism. They all emphasize early-life socialization of prejudice and socalvalues. These theories, broadly, suggest that racial attitudes matter but racism has taken on a new form so as to fonform to what is deemed an acceptalbe expression of racial animus. These arguments suggest that overt bigotry does not predict attitudes now as well as it did in the past because they are condemned, whites have been socialized to have negative stereotypes about Blacks, and whites percieve Blacks as not holding up their end of the deal as far as working hard to achive the American dream, and whites believe that racial discrimmination is not a constraint that Blacks face in a socieity where alll are equals under the law. That is, the socio-structural thories argue that these racial attitudes are the result of increasing opportunitis for minorities out of a sense of personal threat. These sociopsychological models are more about the belief that Blacks are violating particular American norms.
			- race-neutral models argue that race is no longer central to people's ways of forming public opinion. It is not the issue of race, but that Whites d not suppport policies like affirmative action becaue whites tend to be politically conservative andhave principled reasons to object to racially liberal public policies.
		Chapter II:
		Q: Are their more broad stagnations in egalitarianism and other progressive attitudes on other dimensions, or is ther something about progressive attitudes toward race that hve stagnated?
		Argues:
		- No. Millennials are becoming more accepting of LGBTQ and women's rights but have left behind racialized views
		- Period effects: all people living at that time are effected by some event
		- Age effects: at particular ages, something changes and makes all people, once they reach a particular age, to have particular attitudes or behaviors
		- Cohort effects: all people born within a particular range of years are effected by something jointly.
		- Using macro-level data from the ANES (2006 was not included) and GSS, they show that period and cohort effects demonstrate the lack of movement of racial attitudes overtime relative to other groups concerned with equality.
		Chapter III:
		Q: Are the measures of racial liberallness, specifically racial resentment enough? Or have things changed enough where these are now outdated just as racal resentment was used to update measures of racial liberallness from questions getting at old-fashioned-racism?
		Argues:
		- There are two theories that could explain why younger whites' attitudes have gotten more liberal:
			* continuous socialization - as older cohorts are replaced, so are their attitudes and things will just get more progressive with time; this is not the on they believe is what iss happening
			* symbolic politics - older measures of racial attitudes will look more liberal over time without racial attitudes actually improving; what is changing is that how racially conservative views are expressed change. This is what they believe is happening and when we take a new measure of racial attitudes, not racial resentment, then we will probably not just see stagnation but also be able to detect racial conservativism
		- They make this determination of whether racial resentment performs worse by looking at whether those measures perform just as well by looking at how well they match on to a latent variable of racism among millenials with other cohorts - if these measures still work for white millennials, then their performance should be the same as it is for whites of other generational cohorts.
		- Young whites, while they may be less likely to support items on the racial resentment scale, they are less likely to report more negative attitudes toward policies that keep structural racism there. That is, the color-blind raical ideology that millennials have, limit racial progress.
		Chapter IV:
		Q: Do millennials uphold these racially liberal attitudes people presume them to have when interviewed?
		Argues:
		- Lol, no. They are just as racially conservative. Their use of the color-blind racial ideology is very present and they are very concerned with perceptions of them looking like an old fashioned racist without doing any of the work to solve these systematic issues.
		Chapter V:
		Q: For these young white folks who talk about the importance of diversity, how ``fun" it is to have some, what are their policy views?
		Argues:
		- Basically, their views on policy aren't more liberal.
		Chapter VI:
		Q: How can we detect a color-blind racial ideology?
		Argues:
		- Color-blind racial ideology has some common features:
			* viewing race as an invisible characteristic
			* viewing race as a taboo topic
			* viewing social life as a nexus of individual relations (where individual circumstance and not intergroup relations account for one's social life)
		- Common measures getting at color-blind racism and whether white millennials look different than whites in other generations 
			* COBRAS
			* PCRW - psychological effects of racism
			* Explicit racial resentment
		- White millennials score highly on these ones that get at whites' discomfort with conversations on race. Tey score much lower, however on explicit racism. 
		Chapter VII:
		Q: How do the COBRAS, PCRW, and RR measures perform in terms of convergence on one another to masure the racial attitudes of white millenials and their differences? Are they adequate?
		Argues:
		- These document things like white guilt. A dimension that can be described as the exent to which Whites recognize racism's existance and whether it is a problem. A dimension these existing measures don't capture, but is important is emmpathetic reactions to racism and of Whites' fear of other groups. That is, measures should not capture what whites think about race and racism but also how they feel about it.
		Chapter VIII:
		Q: How can we come up with a comprehensive measure that not only captures what whites think about racism, but also what they feel about it.
		Argues:
		- The FIRE battery
			* After running a number of computations for factor loadings on the 50-items from the various measures they had been using, they found that there are about four measures that conceptually explain what they think is important and what summarizes these other measures:
				* I am fearful of people of other races
				* White people in the US have certain advantages because of the color of their skin
				* Racial problems in the US are rare, isolated situations
				* I am angry that racism exists
			* It is a battery and not a scale. They argue that we should not additively combine these items for a single measure.
